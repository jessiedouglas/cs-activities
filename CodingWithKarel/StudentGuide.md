# Coding with Karel

## Main Activity

[Activity link](http://hourofcode.codehs.com/)

*  Click 'Start Coding'
*  Skip the video by clicking on the second dot at the bottom of the screen.
*  Follow the instructions and continue.
*  When you get to the second video, skip it.
*  Continue until you get to the third video.

## Challenge: More Functions

Go back to the section 'Tower and Turn Right'. We will be using this environment
to explore more on our own.

Write some more functions! How would Karel:

*  Turn around (180 degrees)?
*  Turn all the way around (360 degrees)?
*  Walk in a square counterclockwise?
*  Walk in a square clockwise?
*  Walk in a square, dropping a ball at every corner?

Have Karel move around the space. Use at least 3 functions, either the ones that
you wrote above, or new ones of your invention.

## Challenge: Loops and Conditionals

Take a look at the [Karel documentation](https://codehs.com/glossary/term/40).
Read about Conditional Statements and While Loops. This section is a little more
challenging, so don't be afraid to ask for help!

Try to write functions that have Karel do the following:

*  Pick up a ball if there is one
*  Pick up a ball if there is one, put one down if there isnâ€™t
*  Move until Karel hits a wall
*  Move until Karel finds a ball
*  Have Karel move around the perimeter of a grid, no matter what size
*
